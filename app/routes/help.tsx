      question: "How does ResuMate analyze my resume?",
      answer: "ResuMate uses advanced AI technology to analyze your resume against Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and job requirements. Our AI evaluates content quality, keyword optimization, formatting, and provides specific recommendations for improvement."
    },
    {
      question: "What file formats are supported?",
      answer: "Currently, ResuMate supports PDF files for resume uploads. We recommend using PDF format as it maintains consistent formatting across different systems and is widely accepted by ATS systems."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the analysis take?",
      answer: "Our AI analysis typically takes 30-60 seconds to complete. You'll see real-time progress updates during the analysis process."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my resume data secure?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely. Your resume data is encrypted and stored securely. We never share your personal information with third parties, and you can delete your data at any time."
    },
    {
      question: "What is an ATS score?",
      answer: "The ATS score indicates how well your resume will perform in Applicant Tracking Systems. A higher score means your resume is more likely to pass through automated screening and reach human recruiters."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I analyze multiple resumes?",
      answer: "Yes! You can upload and analyze multiple resumes. Each analysis is saved to your dashboard, allowing you to compare different versions and track your improvements over time."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is the AI analysis?",
      answer: "Our AI analysis is highly accurate and based on industry best practices. However, we recommend using the feedback as guidance and always review the suggestions before making changes to your resume."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer customer support?",
      answer: "Yes! We provide customer support through our contact form. You can reach out to us with any questions or issues, and we'll respond within 24 hours."
